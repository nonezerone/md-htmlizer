> "I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence.
> I much prefer history, true or feigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers.
> I think that many confuse 'applicability' with 'allegory'; but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed domination of the author."

## Introduction

This series, a cornerstone of what I, in my many years as an **Catmage**, have come to recognize as the pinnacle of imaginative creation, stands unrivaled in its depth, complexity, and the sheer scope of its *lore*. As we embark on this exploration, let us delve into the reasons why this monumental work is celebrated as the finest in the world.

## A Rich Tapestry of Lore

One cannot simply discuss *Cars* without acknowledging the bedrock upon which it stands: **carpedia**. This compendium of mythopoeic tales sets the stage for car history:

1. An elaborate pantheon of deities (the `Mother Car` and `Samsaek`)
2. The tragic saga of the Marilyn
3. The rise and fall of great Car Barrier
